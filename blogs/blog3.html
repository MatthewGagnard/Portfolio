		<p class='blogbody'>I started this project with the goal of learning some dynamic techinques to javascript creations. Most of what I have created so far doesn't really actively create new elements, and rather then just adjusting pre-made things or restyling it. I did find this difficult, but rewarding</p>
		<p class='blogbody'>One thing I wish I had thought about more of before I started was relying on Xref's (or whatever the javascript equivalent is) from the begining. I really didn't use them, or actively consider using them, until the last part of the project. Being able to find things based of child/parent nodes let's me skip trying to dynamically name elements, and rather just find them where I know they were going to be. I think whenever I do my final implimentations, and actually add the intiative tracking and editing, relying on nodes will get me where I need to go.</p>
		<p class=blogbody> Leaving off where I am now on the project leaves me dis-satisfied. Between mid-terms and other Homework projects I can no longer justify trying to do much work on it now, BUT this is definitly a project I want to return to, and hopefully can transform it into more of a pet project of mine.</p>
