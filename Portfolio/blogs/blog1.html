		<h1 class='panel '> Time Management</h1>
		<p class='blogbody'>Finding time to do what you need can be difficult. As we get older this gets more and more true. At the age of 26 with a wife and a 2 year old, this has become the most true. The power of time management has become the beacon by wich I am able to get anything done. A few things I focus on in my life to be able to get done</p>
		<p class='blogbody'>Make a schedule: Being able to be held acountable by your own hand writing can seriously help. You need to be able to see that schedule PHYSICALLY and so that the reasoning of why you put that their is important </p>
		<p class=blogbody> Reward yourself from the schedule: You need to remember that as humans, we do things for two real reasons, fear and reward. If your only motivator for getting your tasks done is the fear of failure/reprocussions, not only will your work be shody, but when you are mentally broken, you won't have any motivator. Schedule yourself some of that free time, have a breather. Play a game, watch a show, go take in some fresh air, cause if you don't, your work will never reflect it.</p>
