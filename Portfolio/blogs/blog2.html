		<p class='blogbody'>Recently, I have been devoting more time to my primary hobby. I meet up for a few hours via Zoom, and let out a little steam pretending to be someone I'm not. It's a good time, and I highly recommended it. The newest group I have been playing with, however, is not made up solely of strangers or close friends, but of critical coworkers, superiors and subordinate alike. Since that time I have also noticed an uptick in our working relationship, and our work efficieny and I want to talk about it.</p>
		<p class='blogbody'>Of course spending time with people will increase your compatibility, but I think that D&D has really accelerated that process. The mix of doing something that can be considered "Cringe" in other settings (Speaking primarily in a terrible mid-west accent) allows for a vulnerability that can't quite be found just playing soft ball together. All of this with added benefit of a collective goal, making memories, allowing for a companionship to grow</p>
		<p class=blogbody> Where I find it has helped the most, is learning each others personal styles. Ever since our game has started, I have found that a better understanding about our WORK styles as well as personality has grown. Their is more trust in our ability to complete tasks, and understanding of where our frustrations might be coming from. I have always recomened D&D, but you should definitly try it with those you work with as well.</p>
